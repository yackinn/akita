title: Class Support
---

Akita also supports using a `class` as the underlying value instead of a plain object. In most cases, we don't recommend doing so for the following reasons:

1. We canâ€™t store classes in the database. A typical example of this is when you need to save the store snapshot.
2. Classes are harder to use with web workers, due to serialization concerns.
3. There are various third-party tools (for example `immer`) that only work with plain objects.

However, sometimes they can be useful. Here's an example that uses a class:

```ts title="user.model.ts"
export class User {
  constructor({ firstName, lastName, token }: Partial<User>) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.token = token;
  }

  get name() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
}
```

```ts title="user.store.ts"
export interface UserState extends EntityState<User> {}

@StoreConfig({ name: 'user' })
export class UserStore extends EntityStore<UserState> {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }
}
```

:::warning
The class constructor should accept **only** one parameter which is a plain object
:::

In this case, when you call `update()`, Akita will take care to instantiate a new `User` by merging the entity's current state with the new parameters.

You can use the `akitaPreAddEntity` to create a new instance of the entity:

```ts
@StoreConfig({ name: 'posts' })
export class PostsStore extends EntityStore<PostsState> {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  akitaPreAddEntity(nextState: Post): Post {
    return new Post(nextState);
  }
}
```
